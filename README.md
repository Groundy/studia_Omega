This application was the core of my engineering thesis. The application is an alternative to traditional banking applications, it uses an open banking API "Polish Api" to communicate with one Polish Bank server to provide the possibility to make financial operations. The application uses a custom API to communicate with the backend server. Omega can authorize users by a fingerprint scan or classic pin method. The application implements a system of simple paying method, which is a modified version of well known in Poland Blik method.
